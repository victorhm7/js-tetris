# js-tetris

## A simple Tetris game made at freeCodeCamp using Javascript, almost "vanilla"

## In this exercise we are covering the following methods:

- addEventListener()
- querySelector()
- querySelectorAll()
- keyCode()
- Math.floor()
- Math.random()
- length
- forEach()
- splice()
- clearInterval()
- setInterval()
- some()
- innerHTML()
- every()
- add()
- remove()
- contains()

## I'll put some comments in portuguese inside the code too.

## By the way, it's time to test the Atom code editor. :-)
